# Starbucks_Customer_Segmentation
The Starbucks Capstone Project focuses on the Business Analytics domain of the American coffee company and fast-food chain, Starbucks . It involves analysing how promotional offers affect purchasing decisions, taking into consideration certain traits of the buyers such as age, gender, income and even whether the buyer likes to receive offers.

Analysis is be done using customer segmentation. This is therefore a classification problem where given the input data containing demographic, transactional and offer information of various customers, subgroups containing very similar data points are created and examined to deduce how demographic attributes relate to offer types and behaviour towards offers.
